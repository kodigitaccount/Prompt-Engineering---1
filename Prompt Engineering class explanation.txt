29th dec 
workshop : Roadmap to prompt engineering
******

1- my introduction 
	https://www.linkedin.com/in/kodi-prakash-senapati-a95a60182/
	
2- what is prompt engineer ?
	most of the employee they wanted to learn PE 
	research & booming field
	prompt engineer 2yr back -- new job market
	2025-2030 (rapid growth)
	salary depent on employ(
		fresher -- 7lpa -- 1cr 
	based on organization standar, intervie (salary will fixed organization)
	
today session is non technical session 
	AI TOOLS -- ai tools will pull data give you the informatioon

we will build the code how the promps are create and how to create frontend

3-  front end - user write the query in prompt( any que
	backe end -- generative ai model preprocess 
				fetch the relavant information for the query 
			
	devloper or engineer who will design a prompt is called prompt engineer 

4- how to write a effective prompt 

	being a prompt enginner always write the prompt effectivly 

	open ai - chat gpt ( paidone)
	if you dont write cost will deduction from the organziton

llm model - gpt, llama, gemini ai 

5- i showed the prompt example & i will share the document to you for download these prompts

6- fresher, nontechnical, experince 

==========
ROADMAP TO LEARN PROMPT ENGINEER 
==========

			recurssion
			lambda
			function argument 
			user def function 
			multithreding
			generator 
		oops 
			class
			method
			inheritence
			polymorphism
			encapsulation 
	
4- NLP (NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESS)

	TOPIC MODELING
	text cleaning
	stopword
	pos
	transformer ( BERT)
		ROBERTA

	how to convert text to the vector
		bow 
		tfidf
		word2vec gensim model
	skipgram
	cbow
	ner
	pos
	pretrained transformer 
	transfer learning 
		-- image net
		-- resnet
	embeeding 
	
text generated from social media, comment
	nlp + ml model -- remove the wrong & harmfull content

5- Deep learning & neural netowrk 
	concept of deep leanring framework
		tensorflow
		keras
		pytorch
	
	neural network 
	nerual network architecture 
	ANN (user trained numerical data) 
	CNN (user train image, video)
	RNN  user trained sppech, text ) -- advance nlp 
	GNN (research field)
	
	pretrained transfer learning -- imagenet 
		
6- computer vision 
	yolo (ultralytics)
	opencv
	mediapip
	roboflow 
	image preprocess & video processing

7- generative ai 

	Text bases model
 Multimodel
 Clip Architecture
 VQGAN Architecture
 Taming Transformer Architecture
 Autoencoder
 VAE(Variational Auto Encoder)
 RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG)
 HUGGING FACE
 CREW AI
 GROQ
 STABLE DIFFUSION
 GITHUB COPILOT
 LLAMAINDEX
 FAST API

8- LLM MODEL -- lanchain framework 
	
	OPENAI  
	GOOGLE
	META

9- vector database 
		how text embeeded to vector 
	
	pincone
	chroma
	milvus
	qdrant
	faiss -- most organization are using faiss
	
langching -- google - langchain documentation 
tensorflow -- tensorflw 

every document - github 


10- AGENTS
	
	agents are interact with llm model fethc the 
	content from internet

	AI AGENTS
		langchin agents
		crew ai agent
		AGI -- research is going on agi
	

11 - every concept we need to learn  & practise the code
	
		keep focus on the code 
			difference why we got error

12- nice resume with client name & capstone project
	BFSI domain 
	
13- upload your resume job market

14- keep research, keep learning, keep giving interview

15- finally offer will be release

==== complete & indepht roadmap for 

GENERATIVE AI & PROMPT ENGINEERING =======
		+ 
		MACHINE LEANRING model (reg, classif, cluster)
		DATA ANLYST (eda)
		statistic 

FRONT ENDT
DEPLOYMENT 
	MLOPS 
	CICD PIPELINE
	
AZUR AI 
POWERBI 
SQL DATABASE

==== FULL STACK DATASCIENCE & GENERATIVE AI =======

project -1 : create prompt using basic python
==
	1- simple prompt creation in python 
	2- prompt create based on user input function
	3- promt creation using loops
	4- Generating Multiple Prompts Dynamically Using Lists and Strings
	5- Advanced Prompt Engineering 
===	
project-2 : open ai api key + streamlit 
===
